# OpenVoPT

OpenVoPT (VoIP Phone Tracker) is a web interface and collection of php scripts 
to help in tracking the movement of Cisco VoIP phones on Cisco based networks.

We found that after we implemented a NAC solution and our user support group
was able to move VoIP phones around without contacting the network/phone group
we had difficulty keeping our E911 locations up to date.  This helps us monitor
such moves and track VoIP phones in general.
